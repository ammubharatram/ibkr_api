# 🧪 IBKR API Testing (Python) – WIP

This repo is a **work in progress** for experimenting with the [Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/) using [`ib_async`](https://ib-api-reloaded.github.io/ib_async/index.html), a modern async Python wrapper for the TWS/IB Gateway API.

### 🔐 Strictly for Paper Trading

> 🚫 **No live trades are placed.**  
> ✅ All experiments connect only to the **paper trading environment**, following compliance and sandbox best practices.
